This module will introduce ggplot2 syntax to create bar and line graphs. Facets and extensions such as plotting using `ggplotly()` will also be demonstrated. 

Data for the code-a-long is a munged OFM April 1 dataset which you can find [here](). For more information about April 1 Estimates and its original format see [Office of Financial Management (OFM)](https://www.ofm.wa.gov/washington-data-research/population-demographics/population-estimates/april-1-official-population-estimates). 

**Handy keyboard shortcuts for Windows:**

- Comment a line or lines: `Ctrl+Shift+C`
- Toggle cursor between script and console panes: `Ctrl+1` and `Ctrl+2`
- Create arrow `<-`: `Alt+-`
- Run Line(s): `Ctrl+Enter`

# Intro to ggplot2

You can copy and paste snippets from this outline into your script or type along. Some code may differ from what will be presented during the session.

## Setup
Load the first three libraries. The fourth, `extrafont`, is optional depending on if you installed the package and followed additional steps [here](https://psrc.github.io/intro-ggplot2/content/using_fonts.html).
```{r}
library(openxlsx)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(extrafont) # optional
```


You can replace the path below to where you've stored the data. Use forward slashes `/` or double back slashes `\\`
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/clam/Documents/github/intro-ggplot2/data")

df <- read.xlsx("ofm_april1_population_final_tidied.xlsx", detectDates = TRUE)
```

## Bar Graph

To create a simple bar graph, we'll use a subset of the the data. Query for only total county estimates (where column `Filter` equals 1)
```{r}
df1 <- df[df$Filter == 1, ]
```

### Initiate ggplot
```{r}
g <- ggplot()
```

### Geoms

Geoms are geometric objects drawn to represent data such as lines, bars, and points[^1]. Within the geom function is a place to assign aesthetics `aes()`. `aes()` takes a handful of arguments and it will vary across geoms. Use the console to look up help on `geom_col()` and find its aesthetics.

[^1]: R Graphics Cookbook, pg 409

```{r}
# adding a geom and using aesthetics
g +
  geom_col(data = df1, 
           aes(x = Year_chr, y = Estimate, fill = County),
           color = "black",
           alpha = .5,
           position = "stack"
           )
```

### Scales

Scales control the mapping from the values of the data space to the values of the aesthetic space[^2]. When we map a variable, default settings are used. To change the default and customize those aesthetics, apply a scale function. 

[^2]: R Graphics Cookbook, pg 409

Most follow the format: `scale_{aesthetic}_{method}` or `scale_{aesthetic}_{datatype}` 

```{r}
# Using brewers to change the color palette
g +
  geom_col(data = df1, 
           aes(x = Year_chr, y = Estimate, fill = County),
           color = "black",
           alpha = .5,
           position = "stack"
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent")
```

```{r}
# Creating and using a custom color palette
my.pal <- c('#f6eff7','#bdc9e1','#67a9cf','#02818a')

g +
  geom_col(data = df1, 
           aes(x = Year_chr, y = Estimate, fill = County),
           color = "black",
           alpha = .5,
           position = "stack"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = my.pal)
```

```{r}
# Formatting the axis scales
g +
  geom_col(data = df1, 
           aes(x = Year_chr, y = Estimate, fill = County),
           color = "black",
           alpha = .5,
           position = "stack"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = my.pal) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma())
```

```{r}
# Setting breaks and new labels for axis
g +
  geom_col(data = df1, 
           aes(x = Year_chr, y = Estimate, fill = County),
           color = "black",
           alpha = .5,
           position = "stack"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = my.pal) +  
  scale_y_continuous(labels = c("None", "A lot"),
                     breaks = c(0, 4e+06)) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("2020" = "Worst Year Ever"))
```

### Labs

An easy way to include plot titles, change axis labels, or legend titles is to use the labs function.

```{r}
# Labels
g +
  geom_col(data = df1, 
           aes(x = Year_chr, y = Estimate, fill = County),
           color = "black",
           alpha = .5,
           position = "stack"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = my.pal) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = c("None", "A lot"),
                     breaks = c(0, 4e+06)) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("2020" = "Worst Year Ever")) +  
  labs(title = "My Plot", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = NULL, 
       caption = "footnote", 
       subtitle = "My subtitle")
```

### Theme

The theme function controls the non-data part of your plot such as titles, labels, fonts, background, gridlines, and legends. There are a ton of keyword arguments you could use in `theme()`: [https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html)

Depending on what you’re changing, you’ll have to wrap your specs with one of the following functions: 

  - `element_line()`: modify the line elements of the theme
  - `element_text()`: to modify the text elements
  - `element_rect()`: to modify the rectangle elements
  - `element_blank()`: to remove the element

```{r}
# Changing the non-data part  
g +
  geom_col(data = df1, 
           aes(x = Year_chr, y = Estimate, fill = County),
           color = "black",
           alpha = .5,
           position = "stack"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = my.pal) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = c("None", "A lot"),
                     breaks = c(0, 4e+06)) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("2020" = "Worst Year Ever")) +  
  labs(title = "My Plot", 
     x = "Year", 
     y = NULL, 
     caption = "footnote", 
     subtitle = "My subtitle") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = 'bold'),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,
                                   hjust = 1, 
                                   vjust = 1, 
                                   family = 'Comic Sans MS'),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_line(color = 'blue'),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'pink'),
        legend.position = c(.5, .5),
        text = element_text(family = "Segoe UI")) 
```

If customizing the non-data elements is too much work, you can opt for some preset themes:

- `theme_bw()`
- `theme_minimal()`
- `theme_classic()`
- `theme_dark()`

### Save the plot as a bitmap output file (e.g. .jpg)
```{r}
# set your ggplot and everything that's chained to it to a variable
my.plot <- g + <other stuff>

ggsave("my_plot.jpg", plot = my.plot, width = 5, units = "in")
```

## Other geoms

We can transform our bar graph into a line graph, but instead of `Year_chr`, use `Year_dt`. The datatype of the variable can influence what geoms can be used and how it is displayed on the axis.

#### Lines and Points
```{r line graph}
# Use Year_dt, a date datatype, to plot a line graph 
l <- ggplot(data = df1, aes(x = Year_dt, y = Estimate, color = County))

l +
  geom_line()

# add points to disinguish the intermediate years
l +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()

```

Note that initializing ggplot this time was slightly different than before. The `ggplot()` function can also take data and aesthetic arguments. The difference is that arguments in `ggplot()` are global and will trickle down to the geoms. You won't have to copy the same arguments for each geom.

#### Bar and Line
```{r}
# Create a data frame of regional totals by year
# Add a new column 'Region' for labeling purposes
reg.tot <- aggregate(x = df1['Estimate'], by = df1['Year_dt'], FUN = sum)
reg.tot$Region <- "Region"

g +
  geom_col(data = df1, 
           aes(x = Year_dt, y = Estimate, fill = County), 
           position = 'dodge') +
  geom_line(data = reg.tot, 
            aes(x = Year_dt, y = Estimate))

# add the regional line to the legend
g +
  geom_col(data = df1, 
           aes(x = Year_dt, y = Estimate, fill = County), 
           position = 'dodge') +
  geom_line(data = reg.tot, 
            aes(x = Year_dt, y = Estimate, color = Region)) +
  scale_color_manual(name = NULL, 
                     values = c('Region' = 'black'))
```

## Facets

Also known as Trellis displays, facets are an easy way to display groups of data alongside each other.

### Facet Wrap

You can use `facet_wrap()` if you want your subplots laid out horizonally and wrapped around. Put your variable(s) within `vars()`. `vars()` like the `aes()` checks to see what the unique values of your variable(s) are and allows `facet_` to do what it needs to do to subplot. 

```{r}
# facet wrap
l +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(County), ncol = 2) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") # the legend may be redundant, let's turn it off

```

*For longtime users of ggplot2, you may have used the `~` notation in `facet_` functions. You've probably seen the `~` used in books or stack overflow answers. You can still get away with using `~` but it has been soft-deprecated and superceded with `vars()` like in the examples shown. 

### Facet Grid

Use `facet_grid()` when you want to split by at least two variables that generate vertical and horizontal panels.

Let's create a facet grid where vertical panels are based on Filter values (where 1 = Total County, 2 = Unincorporated County, and 3 = Incorporated County estimates) and horizontal panels based on Counties. Query `df` for all records except for individual cities and towns.
```{r}
df2 <- df[df$Filter != 4, ]

ggplot(df2, aes(x = Year_dt, y = Estimate)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(County), cols = vars(Filter))  
  
```

#### Factors

There are several ways of changing the labels of facet panels. One is by using a column that is a factor data type. 

Factors are used to work with categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values[^3]. The advantage of factors is that you can set an order to values and sort in non-alphabetical order.

[^3]: R for Data Science, https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html

Factor variables can be used for any aesthetic mapping, not just facet panels!

```{r}
# Create Factor column
df2$Filter_name <- factor(df2$Filter, 
                          levels = c("1", "2", "3"), 
                          labels = c( "Total","Unincorporated","Incorporated"))

ggplot(df2, aes(x = Year_dt, y = Estimate)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(County), cols = vars(Filter_name))
```

```{r}
# Change order of grid columns by changing the levels and labels
df2$Filter_name <- factor(df2$Filter, 
                          levels = c("1", "3", "2"), 
                          labels = c( "Total","Incorporated", "Unincorporated"))

ggplot(df2, aes(x = Year_dt, y = Estimate)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(County), cols = vars(Filter_name))
```


# Extensions 

## Plotly

Plotly for R is a separate graphing library that specializes in interactive graphs. Plotly is part of the [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_plotly.html) family -- libraries that are originally written in JavaScript then bound with R. It has its own set of graphing functions and syntax but it doesn't mean you have to learn a completely new system inorder to have interactive graphs! 

Load the `plotly` and `htmlwidgets` library
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(htmlwidgets)
```

Just use Plotly's `ggplotly()` around your ggplot object to integrate ggplot2 with Plotly.
```{r}
p <- g +
  geom_col(data = df2, 
           aes(x = Year_chr, Estimate, fill = County)
  )

p1 <- ggplotly(p)

# when saving a ggplotly or plotly object to disk, use a .html extension
saveWidget(p1, file="my_plot.html")  
```

## Others

Sometimes ggplot2 on its own can only do so much. Where there is a gap, R users have built on top of ggplot2 and created their own libraries to enhance ggplot2 graphs either with animation, better fitted labeling, or specialty geoms to name a few. You can check out the ggplot2 extension gallery here:
