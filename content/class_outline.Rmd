This module will introduce ggplot2 syntax to create a bar graph and facetting. Extensions such as plotting using `ggplotly()` will also be demonstrated. Data for the code-a-long is a munged Office of Financial Management (OFM) dataset which you can find [here](). 

Handy keyboard shortcuts for Windows:

- Comment a line or lines: `Ctrl+Shift+C`
- Toggle cursor between script and console panes: `Ctrl+1` and `Ctrl+2`
- Create arrow `<-`: `Alt+-`

# Intro to ggplot2

## Setup
Load the first three libraries. The fourth, `extrafont`, is optional depending on if you installed the package and followed additional steps [here](https://psrc.github.io/intro-ggplot2/content/using_fonts.html).
```{r}
library(openxlsx)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(extrafont) # optional
```


You can replace the path below to where you've stored the data. Use forward slashes `/` or double back slashes `\\`
```{r}
df <- read.xlsx("T:/2020December/christy/ofm_april1_population_final_demo.xlsx", detectDates = T)
```

## Bar Graph

To create a simple bar graph, we'll use a subset of the the data. Query for only total county estimates (where column `Filter` equals 1)
```{r}
df1 <- df[df$Filter == 1, ]
```

Initiate ggplot
```{r}
g <- ggplot()
```


Chain information! Below is a rough template of what we may or may not use to build our bar graph (subject to change!). We'll go through piece-by-piece to see each function's effect. 
```{r}
my.pal <- c('#f6eff7','#bdc9e1','#67a9cf','#02818a') # a custom color palette

g +
  geom_col(data = , 
           aes(x = , y = ),
           color = 
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = ) +
  labs(x = , y = , title = , subtitle = , caption = ) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = , labels = ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = , 
                                   hjust = , 
                                   vjust = ,
                                   family =
                                   ),
        axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = ),
        axis.title.y = element_text(hjust = ),
        axis.line = element_line(color = , size = , lineend = ),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        legend.position = ,
        text = element_text(family = )
        )
```

Save the plot as a bitmap output file (e.g. .jpg)
```{r}
# set your ggplot and everything that's chained to it to a variable
my.plot <- g + etc...

ggsave("T:/2020December/christy/my_plot.jpg", plot = my.plot)
```

## Facets

Also known as Trellis displays, facets are an easy way to display groups of data alongside each other.

You can use `facet_wrap()` if you want your subplots laid out horizonally and wrapped around. Put your variable(s) within `vars()`. `vars()` like the `aes()` checks to see what the unique values of your variable(s) are and allows `facet_` to do what it needs to do to subplot. 

For longtime users of ggplot2, you may have used the `~` notation in `facet_` functions. You've probably seen the `~` used in books or stack overflow answers. You can still get away with using `~` but it has been soft-deprecated and superceded with `vars()` like in the examples below. 
```{r}
g +
  geom_col(data = df1, 
           aes(x = , y = )
           ) +
  facet_wrap(vars(), ncol = , scales = )
```

Use `facet_grid()` when you want to split by at least two variables that generate vertical and horizontal panels.

Let's create a facet grid where vertical panels are based on Filter values (Total County, Unincorporated County, and Incorporated County jurisdiction) and horizontal panels based on Counties. Query `df` for all records except for individual cities and towns.
```{r}
df2 <- df[df$Filter != 4, ]
```


```{r}
g +
  geom_col(data = df2, 
           aes(x = , y = )
  ) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(), cols = vars()) 
  
```
