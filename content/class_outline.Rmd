This module will introduce ggplot2 syntax to create a bar graph and facetting. Extensions such as plotting using `ggplotly()` will also be demonstrated. 

Data for the code-a-long is a munged OFM April 1 dataset which you can find [here](). For more information about April 1 Estimates, and its original format see [Office of Financial Management (OFM)](https://www.ofm.wa.gov/washington-data-research/population-demographics/population-estimates/april-1-official-population-estimates). 

Handy keyboard shortcuts for Windows:

- Comment a line or lines: `Ctrl+Shift+C`
- Toggle cursor between script and console panes: `Ctrl+1` and `Ctrl+2`
- Create arrow `<-`: `Alt+-`

# Intro to ggplot2

You can copy and paste snippets from this outline into your script or type along. Some code may differ from what will be presented during the session.

## Setup
Load the first three libraries. The fourth, `extrafont`, is optional depending on if you installed the package and followed additional steps [here](https://psrc.github.io/intro-ggplot2/content/using_fonts.html).
```{r}
library(openxlsx)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(extrafont) # optional
```


You can replace the path below to where you've stored the data. Use forward slashes `/` or double back slashes `\\`
```{r}
df <- read.xlsx("T:/2020December/christy/ofm_april1_population_final_tidied.xlsx", detectDates = T)
```

## Bar Graph

To create a simple bar graph, we'll use a subset of the the data. Query for only total county estimates (where column `Filter` equals 1)
```{r}
df1 <- df[df$Filter == 1, ]
```

Initiate ggplot
```{r}
g <- ggplot()
```


Chain information! Below is a rough template of what we may or may not use to build our bar graph (subject to change!). We'll go through piece-by-piece to see each function's effect. 
```{r}
my.pal <- c('#f6eff7','#bdc9e1','#67a9cf','#02818a') # a custom color palette

g +
  geom_col(data = , 
           aes(x = , y = ),
           position = 
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = ) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = , labels = ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = ) +
  labs(x = , y = , title = , subtitle = , caption = ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = , 
                                   hjust = , 
                                   vjust = ,
                                   family =
                                   ),
        axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = ),
        axis.title.y = element_text(hjust = ),
        axis.line = element_line(color = , size = , lineend = ),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        legend.position = ,
        text = element_text(family = )
        )
```

Save the plot as a bitmap output file (e.g. .jpg)
```{r}
# set your ggplot and everything that's chained to it to a variable
my.plot <- g + <other stuff>

ggsave("T:/2020December/christy/my_plot.jpg", plot = my.plot)
```

## Facets

Also known as Trellis displays, facets are an easy way to display groups of data alongside each other.

### Facet Wrap

You can use `facet_wrap()` if you want your subplots laid out horizonally and wrapped around. Put your variable(s) within `vars()`. `vars()` like the `aes()` checks to see what the unique values of your variable(s) are and allows `facet_` to do what it needs to do to subplot. 

```{r}
g +
  geom_col(data = df1, 
           aes(x = , y = )
           ) +
  facet_wrap(vars(), ncol = , scales = )
```

*For longtime users of ggplot2, you may have used the `~` notation in `facet_` functions. You've probably seen the `~` used in books or stack overflow answers. You can still get away with using `~` but it has been soft-deprecated and superceded with `vars()` like in the examples shown. 

### Facet Grid

Use `facet_grid()` when you want to split by at least two variables that generate vertical and horizontal panels.

Let's create a facet grid where vertical panels are based on Filter values (Total County, Unincorporated County, and Incorporated County jurisdiction) and horizontal panels based on Counties. Query `df` for all records except for individual cities and towns.
```{r}
df2 <- df[df$Filter != 4, ]
```


```{r}
g +
  geom_col(data = df2, 
           aes(x = , y = )
  ) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(), cols = vars()) 
  
```



# Extensions 

## Plotly

Plotly for R is a separate graphing library that specializes in interactive graphs. Plotly is part of the [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_plotly.html) family -- libraries that are originally written in JavaScript then bound with R. It has its own set of graphing functions and syntax but it doesn't mean you have to learn a completely new system inorder to have interactive graphs! 

Load the `plotly` and `htmlwidgets` library
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(htmlwidgets)
```

Just use Plotly's `ggplotly()` around your ggplot object to integrate ggplot2 with Plotly.
```{r}
p <- g +
  geom_col(data = , 
           aes(x = , y = , fill = )
  )

p1 <- ggplotly(p)

# when saving a ggplotly object to disk, use a .html extension
saveWidget(p1, file="T:/2020December/christy/my_plot.html")  
```

## Others

Sometimes ggplot2 on its own can only do so much. Where there is a gap, R users have built on top of ggplot2 and created their own libraries to enhance ggplot2 graphs either with animation, better fitted labeling, or specialty geoms to name a few. You can check out the ggplot2 extension gallery here:
